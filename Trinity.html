<p>The features about Trinity that I appreciate most are how they focus so much on the student's success at the school and for the future. Also, how they put in a lot of time and effort for the athletic programs to make sure they're winning programs. </p></br>
<p>I chose Trinity University for many reasons. I wanted to stay close to home and play soccer at wherever I ended up at. Also, I knew the school academic wise was very good and had the major I wanted to pursue in. </p>

<p>I am thinking of majoring in Mathematical Finance because it interests me the most. Also, I tend to understand math very easily compared to other subjects such as science or English. 

Here are some links to important information about my chosen interest:
